      <h2>Key Issues Throughout the Pages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The homepage was cluttered and overwhelmed users with university branding, and the visual hierarchy confused first-time users.</li>
        <li>The tweets and Instagram sections had not been updated in years, and the broken links reflected poorly on our team.</li>
        <li>The car page listed information in chronological order but forced users to scroll endlessly to read through the carâ€™s history.</li>
        <li>In the newsletter page, users had to manually click to read a long PDF, which felt outdated and cluttered.</li>
        <li>Forms had not been updated in the Join Us page, which made the entire website feel disconnected.</li>

    <!-- Research Process -->
    <section class="research">
      <h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
      <p>We met with the OTR business team early in the design phase to align on expectations.</p>
      <p>Their top priorities for the redesign included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Ontario Tech branding (navy blue, orange, logos)</li>
        <li>Remove outdated content (Newsletter, Blogs)</li>
        <li>Improve sponsor visibility with clear logos and links</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These insights shaped the structure and focus on our redesign.</p>

    <!-- Competitive Analysis -->

    <section class="competitive-analysis">
      <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        To begin our redesign and get inspiration, we conducted a competitive analysis on other top Formula SAE teams (UofT, ETS Montreal) and how they structured their websites.
        They used interactive visuals and clear team stats to attract sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>We noticed that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive timelines were common and were clear and compact to display history.</li>
        <li>Sponsors were structured by tiers, and had clear links to the websites.</li>

    <!-- Design Breakdown -->
    <section class="design-breakdown">
      <h2>DESIGN BREAKDOWN</h2>
      <p>
        Our design process began by reviewing a Wix website that was created by a member in the previous year. Using that old Wix draft, we created a Figma wireframe. This helped to prototype quickly, while applying those new design ideas that were learned from our design and informational interviews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I led this exploration by identifying what new ideas we needed to design, and made development plans for faster deployment.
      </blockquote>
      <img src="../../../../css/images/ontarioTechRacing/wireframe_breakdown.png" alt="Design wireframe breakdown" class="full-width-img">
      <p class="caption">Design Breakdown</p>

      <p>We created a rough wireframe by extracting key visuals from the site, and created a FigJam where 
      we added components that we wanted to keep. This approach helped us move efficiently through our 
      design process, without sacrificing originality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Development Process -->
    <section class="development-process">
      <h2>DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</h2>
      <p>I implemented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Homepage and Sponsors page layout from Figma to Code.</li>
        <li>The Teams page collaboratively with other developers, implementing components and ensuring design consistency.</li>
        <li>Helped ensure that the site was responsive, especially for new students and potential sponsors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="quote-box">
        This experience helped me bridge the gap between design and development, and taught me the importance of clarity and usability when implementing design layouts.

      <h2>OUTCOMES AND REFLECTIONS</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first time designing and developing an application as part of a team. With four designers involved, maintaining a consistent design across all pages was challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, I made it a point to discuss all changes during our weekly meetings so that any design inconsistencies could be identified and resolved iteratively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it was a rewarding experience. I appreciated the flexibility to continue refining our design throughout the development phase.
